# Vehicle-Breakdown
Business Context:
Vehicle breakdowns and engine failures lead to significant financial losses for both individual owners and fleet operators. Unexpected engine failures can cause expensive repairs, operational downtime, and safety risks. Predictive maintenance in the automotive industry can help minimize these issues by leveraging sensor data to forecast potential failures before they occur. 

Automobile manufacturers, fleet managers, and service providers aim to develop data-driven solutions to improve engine reliability and optimize maintenance schedules. By analyzing engine health parameters such as RPM, temperature, pressure, and other sensor readings, machine learning models can be trained to predict when an engine requires maintenance, allowing proactive intervention before a failure occurs. 

The sensor values in the dataset are consistent with the operating parameters of larger and small engines commonly found in equipment like Vechiles, lawnmowers, portable generators, and compact machinery. Some engines operate at lower RPMs, pressures, and temperatures compared to larger automotive engines and vice versa. Therefore, the data is appropriate for developing predictive maintenance models tailored to large and small engine applications. 

Objective:
As a Data Scientist, your goal is to build a predictive maintenance model that can analyze historical and real-time engine sensor data to identify potential failures. The model should accurately classify whether an engine requires maintenance or is operating normally. 

This solution will help:

Reduce unplanned breakdowns and costly repairs.
Improve vehicle performance and engine lifespan.
Optimize maintenance schedules to minimize downtime
Provide data-driven insights to manufacturers and fleet operators for better decision-making.
